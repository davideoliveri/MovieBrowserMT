# **Movie Browser**

## **‚ú® Features**

- **Homepage with Carousels**: The main page displays three distinct carousels, each representing a different movie genre.
- **Detailed Movie Pages**: Clicking on any movie card navigates the user to a dedicated details page.
- **Dynamic Theming**: The movie detail page dynamically changes its appearance (fonts, button styles, and background) based on the movie's primary genre, providing a unique user experience.
  > ‚ö†Ô∏è Many movies have more than one genre. For consistency and predictability I decided to use the first one returned to theme the page. Hence you may sometimes see a non-style-specific page for, let's say, a sci-fi movie because the first genere returned is not sci-fi (e.g. M3GAN 2.0: `/moviedetails/1071585`, included in the science fiction carousel, its first genre is "action", for which I haven't created a specific style.)
- **Wishlist Functionality**: Users can add or remove movies from a personal wishlist. This state is preserved across sessions using `localStorage`.
- **Dedicated Wishlist Page**: A separate page displays all the movies the user has added to their wishlist, with options for sorting and pagination.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: The application is fully server-side rendered for improved SEO and initial page load performance.

This project was handcrafted without using frameworks like Next.js or Create React App to demonstrate a deep understanding of the build process and application architecture.

## **üöÄ Getting Started**

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### **1\. Prerequisites**

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended) and `npm` installed.

### **2\. Clone the Repository**

```
git clone https://github.com/davideoliveri/MovieBrowserMT.git
cd moviebrowsermt
```

### **3\. Install Dependencies**

Install all the necessary packages defined in `package.json`.

```
npm install
```

### **4\. Set Up Environment Variables**

The application requires an API key from TheMovieDatabase (TMDB).

1. Copy the example environment file:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Sign up for a free TMDB account and get your API key from your [API settings page](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).

3. Open the newly created `.env` file and replace `<your_tmdb_api_key>` with your actual key.

```
VITE_TMDB_API_KEY="your-actual-api-key-goes-here"
```

### **5\. Run the Development Server**

This command starts the Express server with Vite's middleware, enabling both Server-Side Rendering and Hot-Module Replacement (HMR) for a smooth development experience.

```
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at **http://localhost:3000**.

## What to do next?

If you want to build for production and test how it would perform with a live nodejs server you can run the following command:

```
npm run build:server && npm run serve
```

Another cool feature of this project is the possibility check test coverage and reports using Vite UI.
To do that you would simply run

```
npm run test:ui
```

This will launch a tiny server that serves the dashboarsd from which you can see which tests are passing, which are not, dependenices of each test and the coverage for the whole project.

## **üìú Available Scripts**

This project comes with a set of useful scripts defined in `package.json`:

- **`npm run dev`**: Starts the SSR development server with HMR.
- **`npm run dev:vite`**: Starts **pure vite** development server with HMR.
- **`npm run build`**: Builds the entire application for production. It creates an optimized client bundle and a server bundle.
- **`npm run serve`**: Runs the production-ready application using the pre-built files.
- **`npm test`**: Runs the entire test suite in watch mode, re-running tests on file changes.
- **`npm run test:once`**: Runs all tests a single time. Ideal for CI/CD environments.
- **`npm run test:ui`**: Launches the Vitest UI, an interactive interface for viewing and running tests, including coverage reports.
- **`npm run lint`**: Lints all TypeScript and TSX files in the `src` directory.
- **`npm run format`**: Formats the entire codebase using Prettier.
